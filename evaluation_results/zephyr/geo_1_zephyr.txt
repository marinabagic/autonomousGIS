"You are working with a GeoDataFrame that is located in '/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/geo_dataframe.shp'."

"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function, inside '```python ```'.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Don't explain the code.
"

"answer this query:"
"plot all the points that have pH_CaCl2 > 6. use geopandas. save the image as a png.
"

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load GeoDataFrame
geo_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/geo_dataframe.shp')

# Load Europe shapefile
europe_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/Europe_coastline_shapefile/Europe_coastline.shp')

# Filter GeoDataFrame based on condition
filtered_df = geo_df.query('pH_CaCl2 > 6')

# Plot Europe shapefile
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
europe_df.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='gray')

# Plot filtered GeoDataFrame
filtered_df.plot(ax=ax, marker='.', color='red')

# Save plot as PNG
plt.savefig('plot.png')

# Display plot
plt.show()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths with the correct paths to your GeoDataFrame and Europe shapefile.
