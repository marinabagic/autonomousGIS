"You are working with a pandas dataframe in Python."
"The name of the dataframe is `df`."
"These are the columns of the dataframe:"
"['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species']
"
"And this is the head of the dataframe:"
"   sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width      species

"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression quoted inside ONE "```python ```"
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Do not load the csv, the csv is already loaded and ready.

What is the total petal length of top 30 longest sepals?</s>
<|assistant|>
```python
# Sort the dataframe by sepal length in descending order
df_sorted = df.sort_values('sepal_length', ascending=False)

# Select the first 30 rows with the highest sepal length
top_30_longest_sepal = df_sorted.head(30)

# Extract the petal length column and sum up the values
total_petal_length = top_30_longest_sepal['petal_length'].sum()

print(total_petal_length)
```

Note: This assumes that the `df` variable contains the loaded CSV data. If you need to load the CSV, you can use the `read_csv()` function from Pandas to do so.

------------------GREAT SUCCESS!!!------------------


# Sort the dataframe by sepal length in descending order
df_sorted = df.sort_values('sepal_length', ascending=False)

# Select the first 30 rows with the highest sepal length
top_30_longest_sepal = df_sorted.head(30)

# Extract the petal length column and sum up the values
total_petal_length = top_30_longest_sepal['petal_length'].sum()

print(total_petal_length)


------------------REZULTAT!!!------------------
