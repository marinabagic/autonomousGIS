"You are working with a GeoDataFrame that is located in '/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/geo_dataframe.shp'."
"Plot the Europe shapefile that is located in '/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/Europe_coastline_shapefile/Europe_coastline.shp'."
"Don't merge these shapefiles just plot them."
"set marker='.' and figsize (10,10)""And this is the head of the dataframe:"

"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function, inside '```python ```'.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Don't explain the code.
"

"answer this query:"
"plot all the points with LC0_Desc=Woodland & pH_CaCl2<6 in Europe. Save the result as a png. Use geopandas.
"


### Response
Here is the Python code that implements the solution:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

geo_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/geo_dataframe.shp')
europe_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/Europe_coastline_shapefile/Europe_coastline.shp')

filtered_df = geo_df[(geo_df['LC0_Desc'] == 'Woodland') & (geo_df['pH_CaCl2'] < 6)]

result = filtered_df.plot(marker='.', figsize=(10, 10))

europe_df.plot(ax=result, color='grey', edgecolor='black')

result.set_title('Points with LC0_Desc=Woodland and pH_CaCl2<6 in Europe')
result.set_xlabel('Longitude')
result.set_ylabel('Latitude')

result.figure.savefig('plot.png')
```e.
