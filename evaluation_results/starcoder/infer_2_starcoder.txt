"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function, inside '```python ```'.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Don't explain the code.
"

"answer this query:"
"Is there a significant difference between 'N' in Austria and France? Use ANOVA from scipy.
"


### Response

Here's how we can answer this question using Pandas and SciPy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
df = pd.read_csv('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/lucas-soil-2018-v2/lucas-soil-2018 copy.csv')
df_filtered = df[(df['NUTS_0'] == 'AT') | (df['NUTS_0'] == 'FR')]
groups = df_filtered.groupby('NUTS_0')['N'].apply(list)
f_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(*groups)
print(f'F-statistic: {f_statistic}, p-value: {p_value}')
```

In this code, we first import the necessary libraries, Pandas and SciPy. We then read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`. We filter the DataFrame to include only the rows where `NUTS_0` is either 'AT' or 'FR' using the `df[(df['NUTS_0'] == 'AT') | (df['NUTS_0'] == 'FR')]` expression. We then group the filtered DataFrame by `NUTS_0` and extract the 'N' column for each group using `df_filtered.groupby('NUTS_0')['N'].apply(list)`. Finally, we use the `stats.f_oneway()` function from SciPy to perform ANOVA on the extracted groups and print the F-statistic and p-value.
