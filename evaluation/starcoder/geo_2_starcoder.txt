"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function, inside '```python ```'.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Don't explain the code.
"

"answer this query:"
"plot all the points with LC0_Desc=Woodland in Europe. Save the result as a png. Use geopandas.
"


### Response
Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

geo_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/geo_dataframe.shp')
europe_df = gpd.read_file('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/Europe_coastline_shapefile/Europe_coastline.shp')
woodland_df = geo_df.loc[geo_df['LC0_Desc'] == 'Woodland']
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
europe_df.plot(ax=ax, color='lightgray')
woodland_df.plot(ax=ax, marker='.', color='red')
plt.savefig('plot.png')
```t.

The following example demonstrates how to create a custom filter to remove all HTML tags from a string:

```
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name:'removeHtmlTags'
})
export class RemoveHtmlTagsPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '');
  }
}
```

To use this custom filter in your template, you can simply import it in the component or module where you want to use it and then use it in the template like this:

```
<p>{{ htmlString | removeHtmlTags }}</p>
```

Note that this custom filter is designed to work with strings, so you need to make sure that the input to the filter is a string. If the input is not a string, the filter will throw an error.

Here's an example of how you can use this custom filter in a component:

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector:'my-app',
  template: `
    <p>{{ htmlString | removeHtmlTags }}</p>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  htmlString = '<p>This is a <strong>sample</strong> string with <em>HTML tags</em>.</p>';
}
```

This will render the following HTML in the browser
