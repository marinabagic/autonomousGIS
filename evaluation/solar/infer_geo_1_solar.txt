"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression quoted inside ONE "```python ```"
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.

"answer this query:"
"Is there a significant relationship between species and sepal length? Use chi square from scipy.
"


### Assistant:
 To solve this query using Python with Pandas, you can follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
```

2. Load the CSV file and assign it to a variable:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/IRIS flower dataset.csv')
```

3. Calculate the chi-square value to test the relationship between species and sepal length:

```python
chi_square, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df['species'], df['sepal_length']))
```

4. Print the chi-square value:

```python
print(f"Chi-square value: {chi_square}")
```

In summary, the Python expression would be:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

df = pd.read_csv('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/IRIS flower dataset.csv')
chi_square, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df['species'], df['sepal_length']))
print(f"Chi-square value: {chi_square}")
```
