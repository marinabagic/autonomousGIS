"You are working with a CSV file that is located in /home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/IRIS flower dataset.csv"
"These are the columns of the dataframe:"

"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
"

"answer this query:"
"Is there a significant relationship between species and sepal length? Use chi square from scipy.
"


### Assistant:
 To solve this query using Python with Pandas, you first need to import necessary libraries and read the CSV file. Then, you can calculate the chi-square statistic using scipy.stats.chi2_contingency. Finally, you can print the result as instructed.

```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st

# Step 1: Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/IRIS flower dataset.csv')

# Step 2: Calculate chi-square statistic
chi_square_stat, p_value, dof, expected = st.chi2_contingency(df.groupby('species')['sepal_length'].count())

# Step 4: Print the result
print(f"Chi-square statistic: {chi_square_stat}, p-value: {p_value}")
```

This code reads the CSV file, calculates the chi-square statistic between the'species' and'sepal_length' columns, and prints the result.

------------------GREAT SUCCESS!!!------------------


import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st

# Step 1: Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('/home/fkriskov/diplomski/datasets/IRIS flower dataset.csv')

# Step 2: Calculate chi-square statistic
chi_square_stat, p_value, dof, expected = st.chi2_contingency(df.groupby('species')['sepal_length'].count())

# Step 4: Print the result
print(f"Chi-square statistic: {chi_square_stat}, p-value: {p_value}")


------------------REZULTAT!!!------------------

Chi-square statistic: 0.0, p-value: 1.0
