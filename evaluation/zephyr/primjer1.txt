    "Follow these instructions:"
    "1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression quoted inside ONE "```python ```"
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Do not load the csv, the csv is already loaded and ready.

What is the total petal length</s>
<|assistant|>
To find the total petal length, we can add up all the values in the 'petal_length' column. Here's the Python code to do that:

```python
total_petal_length = df['petal_length'].sum()
print(total_petal_length)
```

This code assigns the sum of the 'petal_length' column to a variable called `total_petal_length`, and then prints it out. You can replace `df` with the name of your actual dataframe if it's different.

------------------GREAT SUCCESS!!!------------------


total_petal_length = df['petal_length'].sum()
print(total_petal_length)


------------------REZULTAT!!!------------------
