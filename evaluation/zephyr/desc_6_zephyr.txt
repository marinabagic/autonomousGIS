"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression that can be called with the `exec()` function, inside '```python ```'.
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Don't explain the code.
