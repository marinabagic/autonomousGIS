"You are working with a pandas dataframe in Python."
"The name of the dataframe is `df`."
"These are the columns of the dataframe:"
"['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species']

"And this is the head of the dataframe:"

"Follow these instructions:"
"1. Convert the query to executable Python code using Pandas.
2. The solution should be a Python expression quoted inside ONE "```python ```"
3. The code should represent a solution to the query.
4. If not instructed otherwise, print the final result variable.
5. If you are asked to plot something, save it as a plot.png.
6. Do not load the csv, the csv is already loaded and ready.

What is the average petal length of top 30 longest sepals?</s>
<|assistant|>
```python
# Sort the dataframe by'sepal_length' in descending order
df_sorted = df.sort_values('sepal_length', ascending=False)

# Select the top 30 rows based on'sepal_length'
top_30 = df_sorted.head(30)

# Extract the 'petal_length' column from the top 30 rows
petal_lengths = top_30['petal_length']

# Calculate the average petal length
average_petal_length = petal_lengths.mean()

print(average_petal_length)
```

Note: This assumes that the'sepal_length' column is used to determine the longest sepals. If a different column is used, replace'sepal_length' in the sorting and indexing steps.

------------------GREAT SUCCESS!!!------------------


# Sort the dataframe by'sepal_length' in descending order
df_sorted = df.sort_values('sepal_length', ascending=False)

# Select the top 30 rows based on'sepal_length'
top_30 = df_sorted.head(30)

# Extract the 'petal_length' column from the top 30 rows
petal_lengths = top_30['petal_length']

# Calculate the average petal length
average_petal_length = petal_lengths.mean()

print(average_petal_length)
